From <a href="/en/road-trip-crater-lake" title="Road Trip, Crater Lake">Crater Lake</a> we drove further.

Went along Columbia river.

  Our next stop was St. Helen's volcano. It is famous for its massive eruption in 1980.
  Wikipedia has following image of that event:

We could only observe the aftermath that eruption left.

Forrest turned to fossil.

Massive trees, compared to our Ford.

You can see the direction of explosion in the fallen trees.

The volcano is still active and sends out small clouds of steam from time to time.
