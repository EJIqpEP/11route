Close to our hotel was natural park Xcaret - a big park in jungles on the beach.
There lives a lot of animals and you can also swim in underground rivers.
</section>

Parrots are greeting us on the entrance.

There are a lot of parrots here, actually. They are sitting on almost every corner.

Green parrots are eating something.

<section class="text-block">
What's interesting is that all parrots are free and sitting outside, when all the other birds are closed in special aviary.
Probably parrots don't want to leave :)
</section>

Bird, looks like a turkey.

<section class="text-block">
There are three rivers in the park where you can swim in the stylish pink life-west.
One of them is completely underground, the rest are mixed.
</section>

Mountain lion is hiding in the trees.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/26004882292/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Mountain lion in the trees"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/26004882292_56cb9a0da9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mountain lion in the trees"></a>

Manatees are swimming in the big pool. For an additional fee you can swim with them, but there were no volounters.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/25824567710/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Manatee"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/25824567710_9eda5f51bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Manatee"></a>

Sea turtle in the aquarium.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/26097410645/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Sea turtle"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1549/26097410645_35835385f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sea turtle"></a>

And more turtles in the bay. As far as I understood - they are breeding these turtles here in the park.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/25492643974/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Many turtles"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1608/25492643974_95d4e583d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Many turtles"></a>

Stingrays. You can swim with them too, for additional fee.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/26097410265/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Stingrays"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/26097410265_4dba9aa239_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Stingrays"></a>

And sharks. Yes, it's possible to swim with them too. But again, no volounteers :)

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/25494803963/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Nurse sharks"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/25494803963_86bf530892_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Nurse sharks"></a>

Raccoons are sleeping.

<section class="text-block">
There is also a butterflies park there - a special closed building where the temperature is high and it's very wet.
But apparently butterflies like that kind of weather :)
</section>

Butterflies are feed fruits and asked not to be touched.

There are flocks of them flying around, but I didn't manage to catch on in the fly on my camera.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/118782975@N05/26004882732/in/album-72157664195952094/" title="Butterfly"><img src="/images/bg.png" data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1612/26004882732_91f50c3cf0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Butterfly"></a>

And in the end we took a ride in a small boat in another river.
